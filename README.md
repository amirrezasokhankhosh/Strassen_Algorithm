# Strassen_Algorithm

The Strassen algorithm is an algorithm for matrix multiplication. It is faster than the
standard matrix multiplication algorithm and is useful in practice for large matrices.

Write your inputs in input.txt file
```
first
 - first matrix -
second
 - second matrix -
```

**The shape of input matrices must be (2^k , 2^k)**
